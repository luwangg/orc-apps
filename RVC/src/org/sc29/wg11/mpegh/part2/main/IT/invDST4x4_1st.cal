This software module was originally developed by 
Eduardo Juarez, Wei Jianguo and Ren Rong, 
in the course of development of the ISO/IEC 23002-5 (Video Tool Library) 
for reference purposes and its performance may not have been optimized. 
This software module is an implementation of one or more tools as 
specified by the ISO/IEC 23002-5.

ISO/IEC gives You a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, copyright 
license to copy, distribute, and make derivative works of this software 
module or modifications thereof for use in implementations of the

Those intending to use this software module in products are advised that 
its use may infringe existing patents. ISO/IEC have no liability for use 
of this software module or modifications thereof.

Copyright is not released for products that do not conform to audiovisual 
and image-coding related ITU Recommendations and/or ISO/IEC International 
Standards.

Assurance that the originally developed software module can be used 
(1) in the ISO/IEC 23002-5 once the ISO/IEC 23002-5 has been adopted; and 
(2) to develop the ISO/IEC 23002-5: 

UPM grants ISO/IEC all rights necessary to 
include the originally developed software module or modifications thereof 
in the ISO/IEC 23002-5 and to permit ISO/IEC to offer You a royalty-free,

derivative works for use in implementations of the ISO/IEC 23002-5 in 
products that satisfy conformance criteria (if any), and to the extent 
that such originally developed software module or portions of it are 
included in the ISO/IEC 23002-5.  To the extent that UPM
owns patent rights that would be required to make, use, or 
sell the originally developed software module or portions thereof 
included in the ISO/IEC 23002-5 in a conforming product, UPM
will assure the ISO/IEC that it is willing to 
negotiate licenses under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and
